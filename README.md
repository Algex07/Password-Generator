This is a password generator. 
variables were created to meet the functionality criteria for the users:
lowerscase, uppercase, special characters and numbers. 
a function was created to generate password. 
Before that we had to get the input from the users specifying what they wanted in the password(lenght, etc...)
parseInt command was use to get a number input from the user in the prompt box as changing a srting value in to a number value.
after the lenght criteria were met the user continue to get a display confirmation box for the criteria (lowercase?,uppercase, numbers? and specialcharacters).
"if" statement were use to capture the userinput and the userchoices were added together after which a  password with the specific lenght were generated from the pool of userchoices by using the Math.floor/Math.random.
After functionality, styling was apply to give  the application a simple but professional look. Borders and colors scheme were added.
